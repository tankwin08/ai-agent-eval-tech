    "# Comparing Q&A System Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Theory: Absolute Grading vs. Pairwise Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two versions of an LLM system (e.g., trying a new prompt, model, or RAG strategy), the standard approach is to benchmark both on a dataset and compare their aggregate metrics (like correctness or faithfulness). This **absolute grading** is a great starting point for understanding overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what happens when the aggregate scores are nearly identical? Does this mean the two systems are of equal quality? Not necessarily. One system might produce slightly more concise answers, while the other might be better at handling nuance. These subtle differences are often lost in aggregate scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **pairwise comparison** becomes a powerful tool. Instead of asking an LLM judge, \"Is this answer correct?\" (a 1-0 score), we ask, \"Given these two answers, which one is better?\" This forces a preference and can reveal qualitative differences that absolute metrics miss. It is often an easier and more reliable task for an LLM judge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1.  Create a dataset and two versions of a RAG Q&A system (by varying the document chunk size).\n",
    "2.  Benchmark both systems using a standard correctness evaluator.\n",
    "3.  Run a **pairwise evaluator** to directly compare the outputs of the two systems for each question.\n",
    "4.  Log the resulting preference scores back to LangSmith for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us a much richer understanding of the impact of our changes."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, you compared two versions of a RAG Q&A chain by first running a standard benchmark and then running a pairwise comparison to determine preference scores. This approach provides a much richer signal than absolute grading alone, especially when aggregate metrics are close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairwise evaluation is a flexible and powerful technique. You can enhance this method by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensembling**: Using multiple LLM judges and taking a majority vote to get a more robust preference score.\n",
    "- **Continuous Scores**: Instructing the model to output a continuous score (e.g., from 1-10) for each response instead of just a binary preference.\n",
    "- **Custom Criteria**: Modifying the evaluator's prompt to judge based on criteria that are most important to your application, such as conciseness, tone, or creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more examples of advanced evaluation techniques, check out the [evaluation examples](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/productionization/evaluation/examples) in the LangChain documentation."
