    "# Evaluating Q&A Systems with Dynamic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Theory: The Challenge of Evaluating on Dynamic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world applications, a Q&A system doesn't operate on static documents; it connects to live, changing data sources like a production database or an external API. For example, a system answering \"How many users signed up today?\" needs to be correct even though the answer changes every minute. Standard evaluation, which relies on fixed, hand-labeled answers, breaks down in this scenario. A test that passes in the morning might fail in the afternoon simply because the data has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we can borrow a classic computer science concept: **indirection**. Instead of storing the ground-truth answers (the labels) as static values in our dataset, we store *references* that tell us how to fetch the correct answer at the moment of evaluation. In this notebook, our \"references\" will be executable Python code snippets. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a Dataset**: We will build a dataset where the inputs are questions and the \"outputs\" are code snippets that can retrieve the live answer from a data source.\n",
    "2.  **Define the Q&A System**: We will set up a LangChain agent that can query a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "3.  **Run Evaluation with a Custom Evaluator**: We will design a custom evaluator in LangSmith that, at runtime, executes the code snippet from the dataset to get the current ground-truth answer before comparing it to the model's prediction.\n",
    "4.  **Re-test the System Over Time**: We will simulate a change in the underlying data and re-run the evaluation to prove our system remains accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: We use a simple CSV file and pandas DataFrame to simulate a dynamic data source. This is for illustrative purposes; in a real-world scenario, this could be a SQL database, a GraphQL API, or any other data source."

    "\n",
    "This is the most critical part of our setup. We need an evaluator that understands our dynamic labels. We'll create a custom evaluator by inheriting from `LabeledCriteriaEvalChain`. This base class is an LLM-powered evaluator that assesses a prediction based on a given criterion (e.g., \"correctness\") and a reference label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our customization is simple but powerful: we will override the `_get_eval_input` method. This method is responsible for preparing the inputs that get passed to the evaluator's LLM. In our overridden version, we will first call the parent method to get the standard inputs, and then we will **execute the `reference` value (our code snippet) using Python's `eval()` function**. This replaces the code snippet with its live result.\n",

In this tutorial, we are only evaluating code that we have written ourselves in a controlled environment. **Never** use this `eval()` approach in a production system where the code snippets could come from untrusted users."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, you have learned a powerful technique for evaluating a Q&A system connected to a dynamic, evolving data store. By using a custom evaluator that dynamically fetches the ground-truth answer based on a static reference (a code snippet), you can create a robust, end-to-end testing process that remains valid even as your data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach directly tests the correctness of your system on up-to-date data and is excellent for periodic performance checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to be aware of the trade-offs. This method is less suitable for A/B testing two different prompts or models, as a change in the underlying data between the two test runs could confound the results. Additionally, as highlighted, the use of `eval` requires extreme caution and should only be done in a secure environment with trusted code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other strategies to consider for this problem include:\n",
    "- **Freezing or Mocking Data**: For A/B tests, you can use a static, frozen snapshot of your data source. This ensures that both models are tested on the exact same data, providing a fair comparison. The snapshot should be updated periodically to remain representative of the production environment.\n",
    "- **Evaluating Query Generation**: Instead of testing the final answer, you could test the agent's ability to generate the *correct query* (e.g., the correct SQL or Python code). This isolates the agent's logic from the data itself but is a less end-to-end test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this gives you a solid framework for thinking about and implementing evaluations for your own dynamic Q&A systems! \n",
